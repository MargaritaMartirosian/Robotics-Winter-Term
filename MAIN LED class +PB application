/* Main 
 *  ---------UNDERSTANDING THE CODE --------
 *  1. Include Arduino library and the header file for class definition. 
 *  2. Declare variables for the PB and Leds, number of LED and debounce time.
 *  3. Create instance of ButtonLed class (buttonPin, ledPin, numLeds, debounceDelay). 
 *     - makes a copy of the class so we can use the functions of it. 
 *  4. Setup used to initialize. (Setup = function). 
 *  5. Loop used for calling the class , it checks the state of PB.
